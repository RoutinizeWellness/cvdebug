# Stop Applying to Jobs You Can't Win

CVDebug's Chrome Extension shows your ATS match score **instantly** while browsing LinkedIn jobs.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Upload Your Resume**: Paste your resume text or upload a PDF (stored locally on your device)
2. **Browse LinkedIn Jobs**: Open any job posting on LinkedIn
3. **See Your Match Score**: Our extension automatically analyzes the job description and shows your match percentage
4. **Know What's Missing**: See exactly which keywords you need to add
5. **Optimize & Apply**: Click "Optimize Resume" to fix issues in CVDebug

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Real-Time Match Scoring**
- Instant match percentage for any LinkedIn job
- Color-coded scores (Green = Strong, Yellow = Fair, Red = Weak)
- No copy-pasting job descriptions

✅ **Missing Keywords Detection**
- See top 5-8 missing keywords instantly
- Understand why you're not matching

## 💡 Who Is This For?

- Job seekers applying to multiple positions

- Know which jobs are worth your time
- Optimize for jobs you actually want

## 🚀 How to Get Started
